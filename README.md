Construction Process

-Materials: Insulated box for incubator structure, wood for egg turner bars and platform, arduino, temperature and humidity 
sensor, heat lamp, servo, servo connector to attach to turner

-Coding: Clayton worked every day on coding for the temperature settings. With the code he made, the incubator will always be 
100 degrees fehrenheit. Jean set up the temperature sensor, which is hooked up to the arduino. It will send a signal back to the
arduino when the incubator is below 100 degrees and from there, the heat lamp will turn on. When the temperature gets back to 100  
the sensor will again send a signal to the arduino, and the lamp will turn back off. Nikki made a code for the servo to turn the 
eggs. The original intention was for the servo to turn 180 degrees very slowly every six hours. When we tested the prototype, 
the servo turned 180 degrees and then immediately back about every 2 minutes. This is one thing we will have to fix for the 
final. 

-Egg turning: Ellie built two platforms for eggs to lay, and bars that hook up to the servo that push the eggs in order for them
to turn. She built them according to average egg size. We expect to build bigger platforms with more bars to push the eggs for
the final. Nikki set up the servo to the bars in order for them to move. The servo spins 180 degrees, and then back. This pushes 
the bars back and forth in order for the eggs to turn. In our prototype, the bars only move about 3/4 inches, but for our final 
we will have a bigger attachment to the servo in order so that the bars will move 2-3 inches. The bars must move 2-3 inches so 
that the egg will turn at lest 45 degrees each time the servo turns on. 

-Critical component is the egg turner connected to the servo
